#Daily Learning Journal 3/19/2018

Today we started off on a sprint to understand most of the basic data types and concepts of Python. I had to learn a whole lot
about how Python scales and most importantly how to manipulate dictionaries. They are an incredibly interesting data type, very 
similar to Java's objects apparently, but still can be manipulated differently. My team sifted through many different modules that we could
use to fulfill what we needed out of the dictionary. We definitely took the hard way out today and I think that payed off immensely, while 
we didn't completely finish, I think we're miles ahead of everyone else considering our skeleton for our project is stellar.
