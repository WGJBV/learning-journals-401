#Learning Journal 3/22

Today and yesterday have been so rough. We've constantly been behind by at least a day and Steven and I have almost been at eachother's
throat the whole project. He is so headstrong and his ego doesn't allow him to ever be wrong. Even if I prove it to his face that the 
changes I made or the method I wrote is objectively better, he still will say "I was just about to get there". He can never admit that he
could be wrong and its INCREDIBLY frustrating to work with him. Ramon is sharp but very quiet and doesn't really participate. Overall
I'm exhausted and I'll have to be here the whole weekend working on at least the prework.
