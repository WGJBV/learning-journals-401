#Learning Journal

Today I learned a lot more about Machine Learning. While the speaker was at points hard to understand he was incredibly interesting and 
he really opened my mind about Machine Learning. It seems like a space almost right up my alley, if all machine learning is r values and 
graphs which it most likely isnt. But actually the speaker was wonderful but you could tell he isn't a professor.
