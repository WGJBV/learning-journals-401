#Learning Journal

While I wasn't in class today I learned a lot about where I want to be with coding. I really should have sorted my feelings about it
prior to taking this class because it has been a major distraction from my work trying to figure it out. I know that I want to code and
that I want to get a job in this field, it really does interest me and keep me engaged like no other subject. I want to continue my education
with CodeFellows and I'm going to buckle down this weekend and prove to myself that I can do this. Now that all my distractions have been 
sorted, I really think that I can soar.
